# Digit Recognition
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for digit recognition using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using the MNIST dataset.
# Introduction
The Digit Recognition project aims to recognize handwritten digits using machine learning. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It contains images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels.
# Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow (or keras)

# Results
The notebook includes the following steps:

Data Loading: Load the MNIST dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Normalize the images and convert labels to categorical format.
Model Training: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the processed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy score and other metrics.
Visualization: Visualize the model's predictions and accuracy.
